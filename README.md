# Hurst Exponent Strategy with Trend Following Portfolio
The strategy being used here is a trend-following strategy combined with volatility-weighted portfolio allocation. Let's break down the components of the strategy:

**Hurst Exponent Calculation:**

The Hurst exponent is calculated for each asset's price series.

Assets with a Hurst exponent above a certain threshold (e.g., 0.80) are considered to have strong trend persistence, indicating that they are suitable candidates for trend-following strategies.

Assets with a high Hurst exponent are more likely to exhibit persistent trends, making them attractive for trading based on moving averages and pullback levels.


**Trend Following Strategy:**

The trend-following strategy aims to capture trends in asset prices. It is based on moving averages (MAs), where a shorter-term MA (e.g., 40-day MA) is compared to a longer-term MA (e.g., 80-day MA).

When the shorter-term MA crosses above the longer-term MA, it generates a signal to enter a long position (buy). Conversely, when the shorter-term MA crosses below the longer-term MA, it generates a signal to enter a short position (sell).

Additionally, the strategy incorporates pullback levels to filter signals. If the price pulls back a certain percentage from recent highs (for long positions) or recent lows (for short positions), it generates a signal.

To improve the robustness of the strategy, the Hurst exponent is used to filter out assets with low trend persistence. Assets with a Hurst exponent above 0.80 are considered to have strong trend persistence and are eligible for trading signals.



**Volatility-Weighted Portfolio Allocation:**

After generating signals for each asset based on the trend-following strategy, volatility-weighted portfolio allocation is applied.

Volatility-weighted allocation assigns weights to assets inversely proportional to their volatility. Assets with lower volatility receive higher weights, while assets with higher volatility receive lower weights.

This approach aims to achieve a more balanced risk allocation across assets, where assets with lower volatility contribute more to the portfolio's performance.



**Performance Evaluation:**

Performance evaluation metrics such as cumulative returns, Sharpe ratio, drawdown analysis, and annualized metrics are calculated to assess the strategy's performance.

Benchmark comparisons are made against market indices (e.g., S&P 500) to evaluate the strategy's relative performance.


**Overall, the strategy combines trend following with portfolio diversification techniques to capture trends in asset prices while managing risk effectively. It aims to achieve consistent returns by adapting to market conditions and adjusting portfolio allocations based on asset volatility.
